## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

### 🔹 React JS
- **Component-based architecture**: Created reusable components like `CurrencySelector`, `ConverterInput`, and `ResultDisplay`.
- **Hooks**:
  - `useState` for managing input values, selected currencies, and conversion results.
  - `useEffect` to fetch the latest currency rates when the component mounts or selected currencies change.
- **JSX**: For writing HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript files.

### 🔹 Tailwind CSS
- Utility-first CSS framework to design responsive layouts with minimal custom CSS.
- Used Tailwind classes for:
  - **Responsive grid layouts**
  - **Theming and spacing**
  - **Button, input, and dropdown styling**
  - **Dark/light mode support (optional)**

### 🔹 API Integration
- Used **ExchangeRate API** (or any other currency API like Open Exchange Rates or exchangerate.host) to fetch live currency rates.
- Handled asynchronous data fetching using `fetch()` or `axios`.
